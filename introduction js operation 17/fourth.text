Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?
ans:-
    Operator precedence:
            Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher 
    precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence
    Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

associativity operators :
        Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher 
    precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.
    onsider an expression describable by the representation below, where both OP1 and OP2 are fill-in-the-blanks 
    for OPerators.
**Mastering operator precedence and associativity is essential for writing clear, bug-free code. By understanding 
these concepts, you can better predict how your code will execute and avoid common pitfalls that can lead to
 unexpected behavior.
